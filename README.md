# Demand-Elasticity-Based-Price-Optimization-for-Fast-Moving-Consumer-Goods
Final year project for degree of Computer Science specialism in Data Analytics
## Overview
The FMCG industry faces the challenges of balancing revenue maximization with environmental sustainability due to products with short shelf lives, rapid consumption, and large-scale production. Demand forecasting and price optimization are key strategies for effective production planning and dynamic pricing. This project developed a pricing decision support tool for FMCG businesses, leveraging these strategies along with price elasticity of demand through advanced machine learning techniques.

## Novelty
- Proposed hybrid supervised reinforcement learning technique  
- Utilized continuous state and action space for price optimization  

## Dataset
FMCG Weekly Sales Transaction Data   
- Link: https://www.dunnhumby.com/source-files/  (Breakfast at the Frat)
- Data period: January 14, 2009 to January 4, 2012 (156 weeks)  
- Coverage: 77 Stores, 7 Product Categories, 37 Universal Product Codes

## Results & Discussion
### Demand Forecasting

### Price Elasticity of Demand

### Price Optimization

## Deployment
The project is deployed on a Streamlit web application

## Summary & Future Enhancements
The hybrid approach, which integrated XGBoost Regression demand forecasting model, demonstrated promising results in recommending optimal prices within 20% above and below the base price to maximize revenue. The project streamlines decision-making of pricing analysts and supports the long-term economic sustainability of FMCG businesses.   
Future works should consider:  
- Use dataset with greater variety of FMCG categories
- Include customer data and sales transaction data from periods of consumer bulk buying  
- Investigate impacts of product expiry dates on optimal pricing
